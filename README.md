SLAM is an abbreviation for simultaneous localization and mapping, which is a technique for estimating sensor motion and reconstructing structure in an unknown environment. Especially, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using cameras is referred to as visual SLAM (vSLAM) because it is based on visual information only. vSLAM can be used as a fundamental technology for various types of applications and has been discussed in the field of computer vision, augmented reality, and robotics in the literature. This project is based on the SVO project developed by Forster et. al and we use it to modify for monocular front facing camera.
