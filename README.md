An approach towards positioning of the copters is based on optical tracking of the sourrounding environment. To this end, a camera together with a power-full embedded compuuter board needs to be integrated in the copters. The camera observes the sourroundings of the copter an tries to find landmarks to compare them to the existing partial map. There are multiple ways to locate the copter in the map and to update the maps information. The goal of this project is too establish the hardware setup necessary to aquire visual information and process it in a seperate computing unit. Afterwards existing Visual  SLAM algorithms shall be investigated for their usage in the indoor copter scenario. The most promising algorithm shall then be implemented on the computing platform an evaluated using the external localizations information.
